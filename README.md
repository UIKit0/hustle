* compressed - bitmap indexes, lz4, and prefix trie compression
* relational - join gigantic datasets
* partitioned - smart shards
* embarrassingly distributed (Disco: http://discoproject.org/)
* embarrassingly fast (lmdb:  http://symas.com/mdb/)

BETA / EAP
----------

Please note that this software is beta/early access.  We intend that you thoroughly enjoy wrangling unimaginably large datasets with this software, but really have no idea how it will perform in your particular installation.  Be nice and drop us a GitHub 'issue' or just email me at tspurway@gmail.com for help.

Installation
------------

After cloning this repo, here are some considerations:

* you will need Python 2.7 or higher - note that it *probably* won't work on 2.6 (has to do with pickling lambdas...)
* you need to install Disco 0.5 and its dependencies - get that working first
* you need to install Hustle and its 'deps' thusly:

```
cd hustle
sudo ./bootstrap.sh
```

Please refer to the [Installation Guide](http://changoinc.github.io/hustle/start/install.html) for more details
